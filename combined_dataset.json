However, the utilization of recommender system in academic research itself has not received enough attention. A research paper recommender system would greatly help researchers to find the most desirable papers in their fields of endeavor. Due to the textual nature of papers, content information could be integrated into existed recommendation methods. In this paper, we proposed that by using topic model techniques to make topic analysis on research papers, we could introduce a thematic similarity measurement into a modified version of item-based recommendation approach. This novel recommendation method could considerably alleviate the cold start problem in research paper recommendation. Our experiment result shows that our approach could recommend highly relevant research papers.",

Unluckily, paper research recommender systems have not received enough attention.

And there is even no appropriate dataset available for the overall evaluation of research paper recommendation algorithms."

Memory-based recommendation makes use of only the users\u2019 ratings for items, say, the user-item matrix, with each entry the rating of a user for a certain item. There are basically two kinds of memory-based recommendations: user-based recommendation and item-based recommendation [6][7]. User-based recommendation attaches higher weights for users who share the similar rating patterns with the active user and calculate the utilities of new items from these weighted users. Item-based recommendation evaluates an item\u2019s utility for a user by first selecting its most similar items that have been rated by the user, then compute the utility as the weighted average of the ratings of these similar items. For an online recommender system, when the number of the users grows to a considerable amount, the computation of similarity of every user pair\u2019s rating patterns would be very time consuming, thus item-based recommendation could provide a feasible approach for it computes the similarities between items offline. Reference [8] gives a nice comprehensive survey on recommender systems."

One is that when a user has just ranked very few items, it is very difficult to generate recommendations accurately due to the little information of the user we have. The other situation is that when a new item has just been registered in the system, no user has yet given it a rate to the item, so that this item will not get the slightest chance to be recommended.

They can help a business to increase sales revenue and help customers to find products to their liking; they also help friends find who share the same taste for things. At the same time their potential impact on scientific research is largely unexplored. We proposed a novel method for research paper recommendation. We proved by our experiment that by making topic analysis on research papers and introducing thematic similarity we could recommend highly relevant papers and considerably alleviate the cold start problem. Even when the user has just rated very few papers, we could still generate satisfactory recommendations."

Through the RRE, NACO, intends to break the silence surrounding the issue of HIV/AIDS, by taking the messages on prevention, care and support to people living in small towns and villages across the country. The aim is also to create an environment, free from stigma and discrimination faced by people living with HIV, so they can access the services, without fear and prejudice, and live a life of dignity. It has proved to be a successful multi-sectoral initiative, of the NACO and a powerful advocacy tool, both at the state and district level, besides enhancing local capacity to deal with HIV prevention."
